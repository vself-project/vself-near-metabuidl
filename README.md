## Intro

This is the repo for vSelf team public activity and source code storage for the METAbuidl hackathont run by Near project. We are a team of developers with specific framework and language preferences so we are building demo based on our tech stack preferences:

1. Next.js / React for web frontend
2. Google Cloud Platform for hosting dockerized services
3. Backend and contracts in Rust

## Concept

Currently we came up with a simple concept of an on-chain lottery which distributes a certain amount of preminted NFTs. The other part of the effort is related to Near / Metamask integration as in (https://airtable.com/shrdNEynK25TGJ91h/tblTtriXzrEiCfpoy/viwGhGQTKiJ4L5JSG/recSnmCyJrMNKDUcz), so we are also trying to see if we can make this happen during hackathon.
